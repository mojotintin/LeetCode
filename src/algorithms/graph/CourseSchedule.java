 * Created by Calabash on 2017/7/26.
 * Problem Number : 207
 * Problem Name : Course Schedule
 * Difficulty : Medium
 * Tags : Depth-first Search, Breadth-first Search, Graph, Topological Sort
 * #---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * # Description : https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/#/description
 * # There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 * # Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have
 * # to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
 * # Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it
 * # possible for you to finish all courses?
 * #
 * # For example:
 * # 2, [[1,0]]
 * # There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have
 * # finished course 0. So it is possible.
 * # 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
 * # There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have
 * # finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished
 * # course 1. So it is impossible.
 * #
 * # Note:
 * # 1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not
 * #    adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
 * # 2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input
 * #    prerequisites.
